An educational iPad game that I made in the summer of 2013 for the University of Toronto's summer program called Science Unlimited. This project was completed under the supervision of Senior Lecturer Steve Engels.

With the current Xcode version (6.1.1), the program does not render properly in terms of the elements sizing properly on screen.
